# TIGER GAME ENGINE

## Build

Tiger game engine relies on PhysX5 as the physics engine.
Since PhysX5 is hard to be integrated as a submodule, you need to manually download and build it.
Pass PhysX5 path to CMake to build tiger game engine.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
python configure.py # download glad
mkdir build
cd build
cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DPHYSX5=${PHYSX5_PATH} \
    -DPHYSX5_PLATFORM=${PHYSX5_PLATFORM} \
    ..
```

Currently, this engine only supports NVIDIA cards since it relies on the OpenGL extension:
"GL_NV_shader_atomic_fp16_vector".
Besides, don't forget to go to NVIDIA control panel
and set "OpenGL GDI compatibility" to "Compatibility first".
